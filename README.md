# SnakeForGBA

My very first GBA game! Just a simple recreation of Snake on the Gameboy Advance.
You can play the .gba file on an emulator like mGBA or on real hardware with a flash cart.
Just a warning now though - the snake is just one pixel wide and berries are just one pixel, so if you are playing on real hardware and don't have good eyesight, I appologize
